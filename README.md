# 📖 Overview

Cincrafit AI is a **Bharat-first Agentic Commerce Verification Platform** designed to solve one of the biggest problems in digital commerce-**fake coupons, expired deals, and unreliable promotional information**.

Instead of acting as a traditional coupon-sharing website, Cincrafit AI combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AI Agents, merchant verification, conversational AI, and multilingual accessibility** to deliver trusted commerce experiences for both consumers and merchants.

The platform creates a bridge between **verified businesses** and **consumers**, ensuring that only authenticated promotional campaigns become visible.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Consumers frequently encounter:

- ❌ Fake coupon codes
- ❌ Expired promotional offers
- ❌ Unverified discounts
- ❌ Fragmented deal discovery

Meanwhile, merchants and MSMEs struggle to:

- Increase discoverability

Cincrafit AI addresses both sides of this ecosystem through an AI-driven verification workflow.
